# IIUC Student-Teacher Portal
### 1st Semester | Structured Programming Language (C) | International Islamic University Chittagong

An integrated command-line management system designed to bridge the gap between students and teachers at IIUC. This program handles academic tasks ranging from routine checks to CGPA calculation and automated notice boards.

### For Teachers:
* **Secure Registration:** Requires a unique "Authority Registration Code" to create an account.

## 🛠️ Technical Concepts Used
* **File Handling:** Manages multiple `.txt` databases for user authentication (`userinfo.txt`, `teacherinfo.txt`), routines, notices, and marks.
* **String Manipulation:** Uses `strtok` and `strstr` to parse semicolon-separated routine files.
* **Time Library:** Implements `<time.h>` to fetch the current system date and day automatically.
* **Security:** Multi-level authentication including a hidden registration code (`Regcode`) and password verification loops.
* **UI/UX:** Enhanced terminal interface using **ANSI Escape Codes** for colorful and bold text.

## 📂 File Requirements
To function correctly, the program expects the following `.txt` files in the same directory:
* `saturday.txt` to `wednesday.txt` (Semicolon-separated routine files)
* `userinfo.txt` & `teacherinfo.txt` (Stored credentials)
* `notice.txt` & `weeklymarks.txt` (Generated by teacher actions)
